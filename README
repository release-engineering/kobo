Django 1.5 update
-----------------
Django part of kobo was udpated to be compatible with 1.5 release. Lower
version are no more supported. As a side-effect, only python 2.6+ is
supported by django part.

From same reason there will be no builds of kobo-django package for RHEL 5
and lower as it lacks required python version.

- RemoteUserMiddleware is now used for KrbV authentication
- LimitedRemoreUserMiddleware can be used to authenticate only on entry
pages.
- LongnameUser model is used for auth backend. It allows 255 characters long
user names (as they come from KrbV)
- Class-based generic views ExtraListView and ExtraDetailView. object_list
helper stays for compatibility, but it is deprecated now and will be removed
in future.

kobo.pkgset.FileWrapper
-----------------------
file_name attribute renamed to file_path.
file_name is now a property which returns actual file name.

Action:
Change file_name to file_path in your code.


Username hack
-------------
Username hack is enabled by default now (when kobo.django.auth is used).
It changes username to 255 characters and also overrides validation RE.

Action:
On postgresql run: ALTER TABLE auth_user ALTER username TYPE VARCHAR(255);
Sqlite users have to use db_update-0.2.0-0.3.0 script.


Worker FQDN checking
--------------------
Each worker's name must match it's FQDN now.
This prevents cut&paste configuration errors when tasks end in INTERRUPTED state.

Action:
Change worker names to FQDN.
Change related usernames as well.


Changes in kobo.plugins
-----------------------
Removed 'lower_case' attribute.
Plugins are now subclassed when a container is created.
Each plugin now contains 'container' attribute.

Action:
Remove 'lower_case' attribute from plugins, do whatever is necessary in 'normalize_name() class method instead.


- Improve PluginContainer inheritance. Also add 'container' attribute to each plugin class obtained from a container instance. (Daniel Mach)
- Plugins are now subclassed when a container is created. (Daniel Mach)


kobo.hub.models.Task refactoring
--------------------------------
Field 'traceback' moved to a file (traceback.log).
Field 'result' content dumped to a file (stdout.log), it is supposed to contain actual task result.
Field 'args' changed to JSONField and data is directly available without any conversion.

Action:
Run db_update-0.2.0-0.3.0 script.


Configuration handling in kobo.client and kobo.worker
-----------------------------------------------------
Configuration no longer uses os.environ to get config file path.
ClientCommandContainer, HubProxy and TaskManager constructor has a new mandatory 'conf' argument.

Action:
    config_file = os.environ.get("<PROJECT_NAME>_CONFIG_FILE", "/etc/<project_name>.conf")
    conf = kobo.conf.PyConfigParser()
    conf.load_from_file(config_file)
    ... and pass conf to ClientCommandContainer, HubProxy or TaskManager


Configuration passed to tasks
-----------------------------
TaskBase constructor has now a mandatory argument 'conf', which is automatically set in TaskManager.

Action:
Add 'conf' argument to tasks classes with custom constructor.
