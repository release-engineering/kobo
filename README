Plugins are now subclassed when a container is created.

kobo.hub.models.Task refactoring
--------------------------------
Field 'traceback' moved to a file (traceback.log).
Field 'result' content dumped to a file (stdout.log), it is supposed to contain actual task result.

Action:

Configuration handling in kobo.client and kobo.worker
-----------------------------------------------------
Configuration no longer uses os.environ to get config file path.
ClientCommandContainer, HubProxy and TaskManager constructor has a new mandatory 'conf' argument.

Action:
    config_file = os.environ.get("<PROJECT_NAME>_CONFIG_FILE", "/etc/<project_name>.conf")
    conf = kobo.conf.PyConfigParser()
    conf.load_from_file(config_file)
    ... and pass conf to ClientCommandContainer, HubProxy or TaskManager


Configuration passed to tasks
-----------------------------
TaskBase constructor has now a mandatory argument 'conf', which is automatically set in TaskManager.

Action:
Add 'conf' argument to tasks classes with custom constructor.
