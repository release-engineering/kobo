Development
===========

Use a virtualenv for development.
For example, install kobo and dependencies in editable mode:

    virtualenv ~/kobo-dev
    . ~/kobo-dev/bin/activate
    pip install --editable ~/src/kobo
    pip install -rtest-requirements.txt

To run the test suite:

- Run `py.test` to run tests against installed versions
  of python and dependencies, or...
- Install and run `tox` to run test suite against a matrix of supported
  python and Django versions (more thorough, slower).

  availability of workers.

-----------

  The client and server must both upgrade to kobo 0.19.0 in order to use this feature.


### BUG FIXES

- Fixed backwards-incompatible change in kobo 0.18.0: if a kobo-derived client
  provided its own `--profile` argument, this could clash with the new argument
  in kobo.


kobo 0.18.0
-----------

### FEATURES & IMPROVEMENTS

- The kobo client now supports a `--profile` argument to select an alternative
  configuration file. To enable this functionality, users of kobo should provide
  a `default_profile` and `configuration_directory` when creating a
  `CommandOptionParser`.

- Fixed a python3 compatibility issue in kobo.http.
- Fixed a crash bug for projects using the default `XMLRPC_TEMPLATE` for the
  XML-RPC help page with Django > 1.

  It was formerly restricted to superusers only.

kobo 0.16.0

### REMOVED

- The HubProxy auto_logout feature was removed. This feature was unreliable and
  could occasionally result in deadlocks, due to the usage of finalizers.

  important to ensure a logout.

### Django 1.5 update

Django part of kobo was udpated to be compatible with 1.5 release. Lower
version are no more supported. As a side-effect, only python 2.6+ is
supported by django part.

From same reason there will be no builds of kobo-django package for RHEL 5
and lower as it lacks required python version.

- RemoteUserMiddleware is now used for KrbV authentication
- LimitedRemoreUserMiddleware can be used to authenticate only on entry
pages.
- LongnameUser model is used for auth backend. It allows 255 characters long
user names (as they come from KrbV)
- Class-based generic views ExtraListView and ExtraDetailView. object_list
helper stays for compatibility, but it is deprecated now and will be removed
in future.

file_name attribute renamed to file_path.
file_name is now a property which returns actual file name.

Action:
Change file_name to file_path in your code.


### Username hack

Username hack is enabled by default now (when kobo.django.auth is used).
It changes username to 255 characters and also overrides validation RE.

Action:
On postgresql run: ALTER TABLE auth_user ALTER username TYPE VARCHAR(255);
Sqlite users have to use db_update-0.2.0-0.3.0 script.


### Worker FQDN checking

Each worker's name must match it's FQDN now.
This prevents cut&paste configuration errors when tasks end in INTERRUPTED state.

Action:
Change worker names to FQDN.
Change related usernames as well.


### Changes in kobo.plugins

Removed 'lower_case' attribute.
Plugins are now subclassed when a container is created.
Each plugin now contains 'container' attribute.

Action:
Remove 'lower_case' attribute from plugins, do whatever is necessary in 'normalize_name() class method instead.


- Improve PluginContainer inheritance. Also add 'container' attribute to each plugin class obtained from a container instance. (Daniel Mach)
- Plugins are now subclassed when a container is created. (Daniel Mach)


### kobo.hub.models.Task refactoring

Field 'traceback' moved to a file (traceback.log).
Field 'result' content dumped to a file (stdout.log), it is supposed to contain actual task result.
Field 'args' changed to JSONField and data is directly available without any conversion.

Action:
Run db_update-0.2.0-0.3.0 script.


### Configuration handling in kobo.client and kobo.worker

Configuration no longer uses os.environ to get config file path.
ClientCommandContainer, HubProxy and TaskManager constructor has a new mandatory 'conf' argument.

Action:
    config_file = os.environ.get("<PROJECT_NAME>_CONFIG_FILE", "/etc/<project_name>.conf")
    conf = kobo.conf.PyConfigParser()
    conf.load_from_file(config_file)
    ... and pass conf to ClientCommandContainer, HubProxy or TaskManager


### Configuration passed to tasks

TaskBase constructor has now a mandatory argument 'conf', which is automatically set in TaskManager.

Action:
Add 'conf' argument to tasks classes with custom constructor.
